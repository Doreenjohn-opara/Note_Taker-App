# Note-Taking Application

## Overview

This project delivers a user-friendly Note-Taking Application that enables users to seamlessly create, view, edit, and delete notes. Designed to simplify note management, the app offers a clean and intuitive interface. It’s a full-stack web application featuring a React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and MongoDB database for data storage.

## Purpose and Scope

### Purpose
The app provides a straightforward way for users to manage their thoughts, ideas, and tasks in one place. Users can quickly create new notes, edit existing ones, and delete notes that are no longer needed. 

### Scope
The current version focuses on essential note-taking features, with CRUD operations forming the backbone. In future iterations, the app will incorporate user authentication and note categorization, among other advanced features.

## Target Audience

- **Individuals**: A simple tool for personal use.
- **Students & Professionals**: Useful for organizing notes, tasks, and assignments.
- **Developers**: A demonstration of a full-stack app using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Features

### Core Features (MVP)
- **Create Notes**: Add notes with a title and content.
- **Edit Notes**: Modify notes anytime.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove notes you no longer need.
- **View All Notes**: See all your notes at a glance.
- **View Single Note**: Click on any note to view it in detail.

### Future Features
- **Authentication**: Secure user logins and personal note storage.
- **Categories**: Group notes by tags like work, personal, or study.
- **Search**: Find notes by title or content.
- **Rich Text Editor**: Add formatting options such as bold or italics.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server-side logic and API management.
- **Express**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing notes.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and easier maintenance.

### Frontend
- **React**: Renders the user interface.
- **Context API**: Manages state across the app.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety on the client side.

## Architecture

The app follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern:  
- **Model**: Uses MongoDB with Mongoose to store notes.  
- **View**: Displays the frontend built with React.  
- **Controller**: Manages requests via Express and communicates with the database.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Operations**:
   - Create, view, update, and delete notes.
2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/notes`: Create a new note.
   - `GET /api/notes`: Fetch all notes.
   - `GET /api/notes/:id`: Fetch a single note by ID.
   - `PUT /api/notes/:id`: Update a note.
   - `DELETE /api/notes/:id`: Delete a note.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Fast load times with efficient request handling.
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports new features without major changes.
- **Security**: Authentication will be added in future versions.
- **Maintainability**: TypeScript ensures code is easy to manage and scale.
- **Usability**: Simple, responsive UI that works on desktop and mobile.

## User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to create notes to store important information.
2. **As a user**, I want to view all my notes to reference them quickly.
3. **As a user**, I want to edit notes to update my thoughts.
4. **As a user**, I want to delete notes I no longer need.

## API Design

| Endpoint            | Method | Description               |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| `/api/notes`        | GET    | Retrieve all notes        |
| `/api/notes`        | POST   | Create a new note         |
| `/api/notes/:id`    | GET    | Retrieve a single note    |
| `/api/notes/:id`    | PUT    | Update a specific note    |
| `/api/notes/:id`    | DELETE | Delete a specific note    |

## Database Schema

```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "content": "string",
  "createdAt": "Date"
}
```

- **Title**: The note’s heading (required).
- **Content**: The body of the note (required).
- **CreatedAt**: Timestamp when the note is created.

## Risks and Assumptions

- **Performance Risks**: With more users, performance might degrade due to limited MongoDB queries.
  - **Solution**: Introduce pagination and indexing.
- **Security Risks**: Without authentication, notes are not secure.
  - **Solution**: Add user authentication in future updates.

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Authentication**: Enable secure sign-up and login.
2. **Note Categorization**: Allow users to sort notes by categories.
3. **Sharing**: Let users share notes via email or links.
4. **Collaborative Notes**: Introduce real-time collaboration on notes.
